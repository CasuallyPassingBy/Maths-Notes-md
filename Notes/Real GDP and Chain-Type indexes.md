We have a problem when we want to calculate the real GDP, since we have that the rate of growth or real GDP, GDP deflator, and inflation rate can change by our choice of base year. 

Then we need construct a way to have self-updating method where we don't need to be changing base year. 

To construct the rate of change of real GDP from year $t$ to year $t+1$ in two different ways. First using the prices form year $t$ as the set of common prices; second, using the prices from year $t+1$ as the set of common prices. 

Constructing the rate of change of real as the average of these two rates of change. 

Constructing an index for the level of real GDP by *linking*, or *chaining*, the constructed rates for each year. To get the index we sum the average growth rate and $1$. 

Multiplying this index by nominal GDP in the reference year to derive *real GDP in chained dollars*.
