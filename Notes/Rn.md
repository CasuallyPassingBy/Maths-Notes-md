Rn is a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] over $\Bbb R$ with an inner product.
Def:********** Let $x, y \in \Bbb R^n$, then we can define the dot product as

$$ x \cdot y = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i $$

It is easy to check that this behaves as an inner product thus all properties of the inner hold. In particular we will care about the norm induced by this inner product.

Def:********** Let $x\in \Bbb R^n$ we will define the norm of $x$ as

$$ \|x\| = \sqrt{x\cdot x} $$

This is a valid norm, then we can get the following metric as $d:\Bbb R^n \times \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$ as

$$ d(x, y) = \|x-y\| $$

and it behaves nicely. From this metric we can define a topology generated by this norm.

**********Def:********** We call the open balls with radius $r>0$ on $x \in \Bbb R^n$, denoted $B_r(x)$ as

$$ B_r(x) := \{y\in \Bbb R^n \mid \|x-y\| <r\} $$

and this will form a basis for the standard topology of $\Bbb R^n$.

Since $\Bbb R^n$ doesnâ€™t have an order relation, we cannot get the supremum axiom used in $\Bbb R$, but we can use a certain property similar to the one in $\Bbb R$.

**Def:** Let $a_1, \dots, a_n, b_1, \dots b_n \in \Bbb R$ such that $a_i \le b_i$ for each $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ we say that the set

$$ R = \prod_{i =1}^n [a_i, b_i] $$

is a **closed rectangle.** Similarly we can define the diagonal of $R$, denoted as $\operatorname{diag}(R)$ as

$$ \operatorname{diag}(R) = \|(b_1, \dots, b_n)-(a_1, \dots, a_n)\| $$

**Lemma:** Let $R = \prod_{i = 1}^n [a_i, b_i]$ be closed rectangle then

- $R$ is a closed set
- if $x, y \in R$, then $\|x-y\| \le \operatorname{diag}(R)$
- If $x\in R$ and $\operatorname{diag}(R) < r$ then $R \subset B_r(x)$
- $R' = \prod_{i = 1}^n [a'_i, b_i']$ , and $R' \subseteq R$, then $[a'_i, b_i'] \subseteq [a_i,b_i]$ for all $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$

**Th (Nested Rectangles):** Let $\{R_k\}$ be a sequence of nested closed rectangles (i.e. $R_{k+1} \subseteq R_k$ for every $k \in \Bbb N$), then ************

$$ \bigcap_{k =1}^\infty R_k \ne \varnothing $$

Additionally, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} R_k = 0$, then

$$ \bigcap_{k =1}^\infty R_k = \{x_0\} $$

for some $x_0 \in \Bbb R$

### Bolzano-Weiestrass in $\Bbb R^n$
If $A\subseteq \Bbb R^n$ is infinite and bounded, then $A$ has at least an accumulation point, i.e. $A' \ne \varnothing$
