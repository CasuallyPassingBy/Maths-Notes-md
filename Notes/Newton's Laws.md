# First Law
In the absence of forces, a particles with a constant velocity $\bf{v}$ 
# Second Law
$$
\bf{ F = \dot p}
$$

# Third Law
If object 1 exerts a force $\mathbf{F}_{21}$ on object, then the object 2 always exerts a reaction force $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ on object 1 by
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = -\mathbf{F}_{21}
$$
If the forces acting along the line joining the object $1$ and $2$, are called **central forces**
