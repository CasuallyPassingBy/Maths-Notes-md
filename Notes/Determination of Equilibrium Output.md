Assuming that both exports and imports are zero, the demand of goods is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending: $$Z = C + I +G$$
replacing $C$ and $I$, from the [[Composition of GDP]], we get that: $$ Z = c_0 + c_1(Y-T) + \bar I + G$$
The demand for goods $Z$ depends on income $Y$, taxes $T$, investment $\bar I$, and government spending $G$. 

Let's now turn to *equilibrium* in the goods market, and the relation between production and demand. To make everything a little bit more simple, we will consider inventory investment to always equal to zero, and *equilibrium in the goods market* requires that production $Y$ to be equal to the demand for $Z$: $$ Y = Z$$This equation is called an *equilibrium condition*. Models include three types of equation: identities, behavioural equations, and equilibrium conditions. 

Replacing $Z$ by its decomposition we get that $$ Y = c_0 + c_1(Y-T) + \bar I + G$$
This equation represents: *In equilibrium, production $Y$, is equal to demand. Demand in turn depends on income, $Y$, which is itself equal to production.*

From the equation we can see that the equilibrium point is $$ Y= \frac1{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I+ G -c_1 T)$$
The term $(c_0 + \bar I + G - c_1 T)$ is that part of the demand that doesn't depend on output. For this reason it's called *autonomous spending*. 

We can't make sure that the autonomous spending is always positive, but we can say it is very likely. The main thing is how to control the term $(G-c_1 T)$. Suppose that the government is running a *balanced budget*, taxes equal government spending. If $T= G$, then trivially get that $G-c_1 T >0$, and so is autonomous spending. Only on the weird case that government were running a very large budget surplus, if taxes were much bigger than spending, could the autonomous spending can be negative.

We call $1/(1-c_1)$ the multiplier, because it multiplies the autonomous spending. We see that the multiplier is always greater than $1$. This makes it so that any change of the autonomous spending is amplified.
