# Overview

Using Stein book on Fourier Analysis

# Topics

- [[Main definitions for Fourier Analysis]]
	- [[Convolution]]

	- [[The Wave equation]], i got kinda miffed with the wave equation since it need a bit more context of PDEs to check for uniqueness, and Huygen's principle
		- [[2D Wave Equation]]
		- [[3D Wave Equation]]
	- [[Radial symmetry and Bessel Functions]]
	- [[Radon Transform]], there's a small problem trying to cover everything about the Radon transform without $L^P$ spaces, so yeah kinda incomplete
