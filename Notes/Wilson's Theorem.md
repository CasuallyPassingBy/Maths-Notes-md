$p$ is a prime iff

$$ (p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod p $$

********Th:******** the [[Quadratic Congruences|quadratic congruence]] equation $x^2+1 \equiv 0 \pmod p$, where $p$ is an odd prime, has a solution iff $p\equiv 1 \pmod 4$, and solution is
$$ x \equiv \left(\frac{p-1}{2}\right)! $$
This theorem actually tells us that $\Bbb Z_p$ is a field
