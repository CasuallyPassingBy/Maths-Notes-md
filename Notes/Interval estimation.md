Links: [[Point estimation]]

While point estimates provide a single best guess of the parameter, they do not convey information about the uncertainty associated with the estimate. Interval estimation addresses this limitation by providing a range of plausible values for the parameter, along with a confidence level that quantifies the degree of certainty.

**Def:** A interval where at least one of the extremes is a random variable is called a *random variable*

There a lot of ways to get an estimation through intervals
