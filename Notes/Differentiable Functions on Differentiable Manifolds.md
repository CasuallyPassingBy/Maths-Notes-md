On a topological space the concept of continuity has meaning; in an analogous way, on a $\mathcal C^k$ manifold we may define the concept of a $\mathcal C^\infty$ function.

**Def:** Let $W$ be an open set of $M$ a $\mathcal C^\infty$ manifold, the function $f: W \to \Bbb R$ is a $\mathcal C^\infty$ *function* each $p \in W$ lies in a chart $(U, \varphi)$ such that $f\circ \varphi^{-1} \in \mathcal C^\infty(\varphi[W \cap U])$. 

**Def:** Let $W$ be an open set of $M$ a $\mathcal C^\infty$ manifold, $F$ is a $\mathcal C^\infty$ *mapping* of $W$ into $N$, if for every $p \in W$ exist a charts $(U, \varphi)$ containing $p$, and $(V, \psi)$ containing $F(p)$ with $F[U] \subseteq V$ such that $\psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi[U] \to \psi[V]$ is $\mathcal C^\infty$ in the usual sense.
