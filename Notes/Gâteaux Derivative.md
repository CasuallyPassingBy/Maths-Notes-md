We have the the limit called the directional derivative of $\varphi$ at $u_0$ in the direction $v$. We get the function ${\cal G}\varphi(u_0):V \to W$, given as
$$
{\cal G}\varphi(u_0)v :=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{\varphi(u_0+tv)-\varphi(u_0)}{t}
$$

The function $\varphi:\Omega\to W$ is Gâteaux differentiable at the point $u_0\in \Omega$ if for all $v\in V$, there's a directional derivative of $\varphi$ at $u_0$ in the direction $v$ and the function ${\cal G}\varphi(u_0)$ defined above belongs to ${\cal B}(V, W)$. 
$\varphi$ is *Gâteaux-differentiable on $\Omega$* if it is differentiable at every point $u\in \Omega$. The function
$$
{\cal G}\varphi:\Omega\to {\cal B}(V, W)
$$
is called the *Gâteaux derivative* of $\varphi$. 

$\varphi:\Omega \to W$ is of class $\cal C^1$ on $\Omega$ iff $\varphi$ is Gâteaux-differentiable on $\Omega$ and its Gâteaux derivative ${\cal G}\varphi:\Omega\to {\cal B}(V, W)$ is continuous. In this case $\varphi'={\cal G}\varphi$.
