********Th:******** Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are two solutions of the nonhomogenous equation $L[y] = g$, then their difference $Y_1 - Y_2$ is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation $L[y] = 0$. If, in addition, $y_1$ and $y_2$ are a fundamental set of solutions of $L[y] =0$, then there are $c_1$ and $c_2$ so that

$$ Y_1 -Y_2 = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 $$

Since $L$ is linear, then $N(L)$ is a linear space then $L^{-1}(g)$ is parallel to $N(L)$ and we only need to find $Y \in L^{-1}(g)$ so that $Y+ N(L) = L^{-1}(g)$.

****************Th:**************** The general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation $L[y] = g$ can be written in the form

$$ y = c_1y_1+c_2y_2 +Y $$

where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are a fundamental set of solutions of th corresponding homogeneous equation, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants, and $Y$ is some specific solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.
