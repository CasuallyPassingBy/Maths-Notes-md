**Def:** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ with characterisitc polynomial

$$ \chi_T(t) = (-1)^n \prod_{k = 1}^m (\phi_k(t))^{n_k} $$

where the $\phi_k (t)$’s are distinct irreducible monic polynomials and the $n_k$’s are positive integers. for all $k$ we define $K(\phi_i , T)$ a subset of $V$ as

$$ K(\phi_i, T) := \{ x \in V\mid (\phi_i(T))^p(x) =0 \text{ for some }p \in \Bbb N^+\} $$

For this section $C_x$ referes to the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $x$, and the ordered set

$$ \{x , T(x), T^2(x), \dots, T^{k-1}(x)\} $$

is a basis for $C_x$, and $\dim C_x = k$. To distinguish this base from every other bases for $C_x$, we call it the $T$_-cyclic basis generated by_ $x$ denote it by $\beta_x$. Then we get that

$$ [T|_{C_x}]_{\beta_x} = A= \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -a_0 \\ 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -a_1 \\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & -a_2 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & -a_{k-1} \end{bmatrix} $$

where

$$ \sum_{i = 0}^{k-1}a_i T^i +T^k =0 $$

Furhtermore, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ given by

$$ \chi_A(t) = (-1)^k \left(\sum_{i = 0}^{k-1}a_i t^i +t^k =0 \right) $$

The matrix $A$ is called the _****companion matrix****_ of the monic polynomial $h (t)= \sum_{i = 0}^{k-1}a_i t^i +t^k$. Every monic polynomial has a companion matrix, and the characaterisic of the companion matrix of a monic polynomial $g(t)$ of degree $k$ is equal to $(-1)^k g(t)$.

The monic polynomial $h(t)$ is also the minimal polynomial of $A$. Since $A$ is the matrix representation of the restritiction to $C_x$, $h(t)$ is also a minimal polynomial of the restriction, and $h(t)$ is a $T$-annihilator of $x$.

**************Lemma:************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$, let $x$ be a nonzero vector in $V$, and suppose that the $T$-anniliator of $x$, $\mu_{T, x}$, is of the form $(\phi(t))^p$ for some irreducible monic polynomial $\phi$. Then $\phi(t)$ divides $\mu_{T, x}$, and $x \in K(\phi, T)$

********Th:******** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and let $\beta$ be an ordered basis for $V$. Then $\beta$ is a rational canonical basis for $T$ if and only if $\beta$ is the disjoint union of $T$-cyclic bases $\beta_{v_i}$, where each $v_i$ lies in $K(\phi, T)$ for some irreducible monic divisor $\phi(t)$ of the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

****************Th:**************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \mu_T(t) = \prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{m_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\mu_T$ and $m_i$’s are positive integers. Then the following statements are true

- $K(\phi_i, T)$ is a nonzero $T$-invariant subspace of $V$ for each $i$
- if $x$ is nonzero vector in some $K(\phi_i, T)$, then the $T$-annihilator of $x$ is of the form ${(\phi_i(t))^p}$ for some $p$
- $K(\phi_i, T)\cap K(\phi_j , T) = \{0\}$ when $i \ne j$
- $K(\phi_i, T)$ is invariant under $\phi_j(T)$ for $i \ne j$ and the restriction of $\phi_j(T)$ to $K(\phi_i, T)$ is bijective
- $K(\phi_i, T) = N( (\phi_i(T))^{m_i})$ for each $i$

****************Lemma:**************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \mu_T(t) = \prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{m_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\mu_T$ and $m_i$’s are positive integers. For $1\le i \le k$, let $v_i \in K(\phi_i, T)$ be such that

$$ \sum_{i = 1}^k v_i =0 $$

Then $v_i = 0$ for all $i$

****************Th:**************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \mu_T(t) = \prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{m_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\mu_T$ and $m_i$’s are positive integers. For $1\le i \le k$, let $S_i$ be a linearly independent subset of $K(\phi_i, T)$. Then

- $S_i \cap S_j = \varnothing$ for $i \ne j$
- $S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \dots \cup S_k$ is linearly independent

**************Th:************** Let $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$ be distinct vectors in $K(\phi, T)$ such that

$$ S_1 = \bigcup_{i = 1}^k \beta_{v_i} $$

is linearly independent. For each $i$ suppose there exists $w_i \in V$ such that $\phi(T)(w_i) = v_i$. Then

$$ S_2 = \bigcup_{i = 1}^k \beta_{w_i} $$

is also linearly independent

****************Lemma:**************** Let $W$ be a $T$-invariant subspace of $K(\phi, T)$, and let $\beta$ be a basis for $W$. Then

- Suppose that $x \in N(\phi(T))$, but $x \not \in W$. Then $\beta \cup \beta_x$ is linearly independent
    
- For some $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_s \in N(\phi(T))$, $\beta$ can be extended to the linearly independent set
    
    $$ \beta' =\beta \cup \bigcup_{i =1}^s \beta_{w_i} $$
    
    whose span contains $N(\phi(T))$
    

************Th:************ If $\mu_T$ is of the form $(\phi(t))^m$, then there exists a rational canonical basis for $T$.

********Cor:******** $K(\phi, T)$ has a basis consisting of the union $T$-cyclic bases

********Th:******** Every linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space has a rational canonical basis and, hence, a ration canonical form

****************Th:**************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \chi_T(t) = (-1)^n\prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{n_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\chi_T$ and $n_i$’s are positive integers. Then

- $\phi_1,\phi_2, \dots, \phi_k$ are the irreducible monic factors of the minimal polynomial
- for each $i$ , $\dim K(\phi_i, T)= d_in_i$ where $d_i$ is the degree of $\phi_i$
- If $\beta$ is a rational canonical basis for $T$, then $\beta_i = \beta \cap K(\phi_i, T)$ is a basis for $K(\phi_i, T)$ for each $i$
- If $\gamma _i$ is a basis for $K(\phi_i, T)$, for each $i$, then $\gamma = \gamma_1 \cup \gamma_2 \cup \dots \gamma_k$ is a basis for $V$. In particular, if each $\gamma_i$ is a disjoint union of $T$-cyclic bases, then $\gamma$ is a rational canonical form for $T$

If we use a similar dot diagram used in the Jordan normal form, we can see the similarities

****************Th:**************** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \mu_T(t) = \prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{m_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\mu_T$ and $m_i$’s are positive integers. The number $m_i$ is the number of entries in the first column of the dot diagram for $\phi_i ( t)$.

********Th:******** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, let $\phi(t)$ be an irreducible monic divisor of the characteristic polynomial of $T$ of degree $d$, and let $r_i$ denote tbe number of dots in tbe $i$th row of tbe dot diagram for $\phi(t)$ with respect to a rational canonical basis for $T$. Then

- $r_1 = \dfrac{1}{d}[\dim V - \dim R(\phi(T))]$
- $r_i = \dfrac{1}{d}[\dim R(\phi(T)^{i-1}) - \dim R(\phi(T)^i)]$ for $i >1$

**********Cor:********** Under tbe conventions described earlier, tbe rational canonical form of a linear operator is unique up to tbe arrangement of tbe irreducible monic divisors of tbe characteristic polynomial.

This helps us to find the canonical form of the matrix, but not the basis.

To find the rational canonical basis, first we see what it must satisfy

Let $\beta$ be a rational canonical basis for $T$, and $\beta_{v_1}, \beta_{v_2}, \dots \beta_{v_k}$ be the $T$-cyclic bases of $\beta$ that are contained in $K(\phi, T)$. Consider one of these $T$-cyclic bases $\beta_{v_j}$, and suppose again that the $T$-annihilator of $v_j$ is $(\phi(t))^{p_j}$. Then $\beta_{v_j}$ consists of $dp_j$ vectors in $\beta$ . For $0 \le i < d$, let $\gamma_i$ be the cycle of generalized eigenvectors of $U$ (being the restriction of $\phi(T)$ to the subset $K(\phi, T)$) corresponding to $\lambda = 0$ with end vector $T^i(v_j)$, where $T^0(v_j) = b_j$. Then

$$ \gamma_i =\{ \phi(T)^{p_j-1} T^i(v_j), \phi(T)^{p_j-2} T^i(v_j), \dots, \phi(T) T^i(v_j), T^i(v_j)\} $$

$\gamma_i$ is a linearly independent subset of $C_{v_i}$. Now we define the set

$$ \alpha_j = \bigcup_{l =1}^{d-1} \gamma_l $$

Notice that $\alpha_j$ containas $dp_j$ vectors.

**************Lemma: $\alpha_j$** is an ordered basis for $C_{v_j}$

We can replace $\beta_{v_j}$ by $\alpha_j$ as a basis for $C_{v_j}$. We do this for every $j$ to obtain a subset

$$ \alpha = \bigcup_{l =1}^k \alpha_j $$

****************Lemma: $\alpha$** is a Jordan canonical basis for $K(\phi, T)$

This will help us find the rational canonical basis of $T$.

**********Def:********** Let $A \in \cal M_n(\Bbb F)$. The ************************rational canonical form************************ of $A$ is defined to be the rational canonical form of $L_A$. Likewise, for $A$, the _elementary divisors_ and their _multiplicities_ are the same as those of $L_A$

### Primary Decomposition Theorem

Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that

$$ \chi_T(t) = (-1)^n\prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{n_i} $$

where for all $i$, $\phi_i$ are distinct irreducible monic factors of $\chi_T$ and $n_i$’s are positive integers. Then

- $V = K(\phi_1, T) \oplus K(\phi_2, T) \dots\oplus K(\phi_k, T)$
- If $T_i$ $(1 \le i \le k)$ is the restriction of $T$ to $K(\phi_i, T)$ and $C_i$ is the rational canonical form of $T_i$, then $C_1 \oplus C_2 \oplus \dots \oplus C_k$ is the rational canonical form

********Th:******** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Then $V$ is a direct sum of $T$-cydic subspaces $C_{v_i}$ where each $v_i$ lies in $K(\phi_i, T)$ for some irreducible monic divisor $\phi(t)$ of the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

## How to calculate it

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix. We need to calculate $\chi_A(t)$, and look at the irreducible factors. Then we want

$$ \chi_A(t) = (-1)^n\prod_{i =1}^k (\phi_i(t))^{n_i} $$

We want to calculate $\phi_i(A)$ for each $i$. We will focus, in one and just call it $\phi$. Then we want to calculate the the number of dots in the first row of the dot diagram, and so on for the $i$th row till we are done.

The number of dots in each column tells you the power of the to elevate $\phi$ for each block. Then each rational block is the companion matrix of $\phi^{c_i}$ with $c_i$ being the number of dots in the $i$th column.

The number of dots in the first row, also tell us the the number of columns of the diagram, and there’s exactly $r_1$ vectors, $v_1, \dots, v_{r_1}$ with annilihators $\phi^{c_1}, \phi^{c_2}, \dots, \phi^{c_{r_1}}$ respectively, and such that

$$ \beta =\bigcup_{i = 1}^{r_1}\{ v_i, A v_i, \dots, A^{c_i -1} v\} $$

is a rational canonical basis for $L_A$

We need to calculate the $\phi(L_A)$, and their respective powers, and find its nullspaces. We need a basis for each nullspace.

From there we must choose each $v_i$, and calculate the $A^j v_i$ corresponding to the base. When we are done with $\phi$. We must repeat for all possible monic irreducible factors.

Finally we have the rational canonical form, and the rational canonical basis for the matrix $A$.
