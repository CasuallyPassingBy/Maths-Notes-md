In topology, there are various ways to have a space to be separate, meaning to separate points, or closed sets. 

- [[Kolmogorov spaces]] or $T_0$ spaces
- [[Fr√©chet spaces]] or $T_1$ spaces
- [[Hausdorff spaces]] or $T_2$ spaces
- [[Regular spaces]] which are related to $T_3$ spaces
- [[Tychonoff spaces]] which are related to $T_{3 \frac12}$ spaces
- [[Normal Spaces]] which are related to $T_4$ spaces
