# General Remarks

Let $X$ be a randon variable and let $F$ be the cdf, with an inverse $F^{-1}$, and $U \sim \operatorname{unif}(0,1)$, then

- $F(X) \stackrel{d}{=} U$
- $F^{-1}(U) \stackrel{d}{=} X$

Meaning if we can calculate the inverse of a cdf, then we can model the random variable using just an uniform distribution
# Examples
there are quite a few continuous distributions:

- [[Exponential Distribution]]
- [[Gamma Distribution]]
- [[Beta Distribution]]
- [[Weibull Distribution]]
- [[Normal Distribution]]
- [[Lognormal Distribution]]
- [[Chi-squared Distribution]]
- [[Student's t-distribution]]
- [[F-distribution]]
