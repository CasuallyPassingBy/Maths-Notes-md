Let $A$ be a subset of $X$ is **relatively compact** in $X$ if the closure $\overline A$ on $X$ is compact

A subset $A$ of a complete metric space $X$ is relatively compact in $X$ iff it is totally bounded

Let $A$ be a subset of $X$:
- If $A$ is relatively compact in $X$, then $A$ is totally bounded
- If $X$ is compact, then $A$ is relatively compact in $X$
