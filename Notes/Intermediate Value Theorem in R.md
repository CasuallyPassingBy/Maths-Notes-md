## Preservation of Connectedness

Let $f:D\to\Bbb{R}$, be continuous and $E\subseteq D$, where $E$ is [[Perfect and Connected Sets in R|connected]]. Then $f(E)$ is connected.

## IVT

Let $f:[a,b]\to\Bbb{R}$, if $L$ is real number such that $f(a) < L <f(b)$ or $f(a)>L>f(b)$, there’s a $c\in(a,b)$ such that $f(c) = L$.

## Intermediate Value/Darboux Property

A function $f$ has the _intermediate value property_ on an interval $[a, b]$ if for all $x<y$ in $[a, b]$ and all $L$ between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$, it is always possible to find a point $c ∈ (x, y)$ where $f(c) = L$.
