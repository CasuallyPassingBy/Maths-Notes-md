There are quite a few methods of interpolation of data, using polynomials:

One of the reason, we know we can approximate continuous functions with polynomials is by the [[Stone-Weierstrass Theorem|Weiestrass Approximation Theorem]]

- [[Neville's Method]]
- [[Newton's Divided Difference]]
- [[Hermite Interpolation]]
- [[Cubic Spline Interpolation]]
- [[Parametric Curves]]
