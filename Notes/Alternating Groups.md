**Def:** Let $A_n = \{\sigma \in S_n \mid \text{sgn}(\sigma) = 1\} \subseteq S_n$. Having $\text{sgn}: S_n \to \{-1, 1\}$ a group homomorphism, them we see that $A_n := \ker(\text{sgn})$. 

**Prop:** $A_n \le S_n$, and it is called the *alternating group of order $n$*, and $|A_n| = n!/2$. 

**Prop:** For $n \ge 3$, the alternating group $A_n$ is generated by the $3$-cycles

**Cor:** For $n \ge 3$, the alternating group $A_n$ is generated by the $3$-cycles of the form $(1, 2, i)$ for $i \ge 3$.
