********Def:******** A differential equations where the independent variable doesn’t appear are important enough to get their own name, **********autonomous********** and are of the form

$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y) $$

Which is a special case of a separable differential equation, and we know how they are solved.

The zeros of $f(y)$ are called _critical points_ or _equilibrium solutions_ since if $y$ is equal to any of this zeros, then the differential equation won’t move.
