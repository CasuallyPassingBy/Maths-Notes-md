## Hausdorff Maximal Principle
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of sets. If, for each chain $C \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ , there exists a member of $\mathcal{F}$ that contains all the members of $C$, then $\mathcal{F}$ contains a maximal member. This is equivalent to the [[Axiom of Choice]].

A redefinition on linearly independent set. Let $S$ be a subset of a vector space $V$. A maximal linearly independent set of $S$, is a subset $B$ of $S$, which:

- $B$ is linearly independent
- The only linearly independent subset of $S$, that contains $B$ is $B$ itself.

Let $V$be a vector space, and $S$ be subset that generates $V$. If $\beta$ is a maximal linearly independent subset of $S$, then $\beta$ is a basis for $V$.

Let $S$ be a linearly independent on $V$, then there exists a maximal linearly independent set that contains $S$.

Th: Every vector space contains a basis
