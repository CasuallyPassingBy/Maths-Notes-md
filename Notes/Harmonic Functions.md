**Def:** A function $u: A\subseteq \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$ where $A$ is an open subset of $\Bbb R^n$ is called ********_harmonic on $A$_ if $\Delta u  =0$ in $A$.

We can develop a lot of theory for [[2D Harmonic Functions]] using complex analysis

Harmonic functions are the solution to the [[The Heat Equation|steady-state heat equation]]

Here are some solutions of Laplace's Equation:
- [[Laplace's Equation on the disk]]
- [[Laplace's Equation in the semi finite strip]]
- [[Laplace's Equation in the annulus]]
- [[Laplace's Equation in the upper half-space]]
	- [[Laplace's Equation in the upper half-plane]]
- [[Laplace's Equation in a strip]]
