## Cayley-Hamilton Theorem
Supose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$, then we define the _characteristic polynomial_ of $T$, as
$$ \chi_T(t ) = \det (T-tI) $$
with $I$ being the identity map. Similarly, we can define the characteristic polynomial of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$

$$ \chi_A (t) = \det (A-tI) $$

********Th:******** The characteristic polynomial of any diagonalizable linear operator on a vector space $V$ over a field $\Bbb F$ splits over $\Bbb F$.

********Th:******** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then
- $\chi_T$ has degree $\dim V$
- The zeros of $\chi_T$ are the eigenvalues of $T$

**Th:** Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$, with $V$ being a finite dimensional vector space such that $\chi_T$ splits. Let $\lambda_1,\dots \lambda_m$ denote the distinct eigenvalues of $T$. Then polynomial

$$ \chi_T (z) =\prod_{k = 1}^m (z-\lambda_{k})^{d_k} $$

are called multiplicities $d_1, \dots, d_m$ of the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_1, \dots \lambda_m$. We have that $1 \le \dim E(\lambda_i, T) \le d_i$ for all $i$.

Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ and $p \in \Bbb F[x]$. Then $N(p(T))$ and $R(p(T))$ are invariant under $T$

**Prop:** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ invertible. Then

$$ \chi_{T^{-1}} (z) = \frac{1}{\chi_T (0)}z^{\dim V} \chi_T\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) $$

### Cayley-Hamiliton Theorem
Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then $\chi_T (T) = 0$

## Minimal Polinomial

**Def:** A **monic polynomial is a polynomial whose highest degree coefficient equals $1$

********Th:******** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then there is a unique monic polynomial $p$ of smallest degree such that $p(T) = 0$

**Def:** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. The **minimal polynomial** of $T$ is the unique monic polynomial $\mu_T$ of the smalles degree such that $\mu_T(T) = 0$

**************Th:************** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then $p(T) = 0$ iff $p$ is a multiple of $\mu_T$

********Cor:******** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then $\chi_T$ is a multiple of $\mu_T$

**Th:** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then the zeros of $\mu _T$ are precisely the eigenvalues of $T$

********Th:******** Let $T$ be a linear operator on an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ such that $V$ is a $T$ -cyclic subspace of itself. Then $\chi_T$ and $\mu_T$ have the same degree, and hence ${\chi_T(t) = ( - 1)^n\mu_T}$.

**Cor:** Let $T$ be a diagonalizable linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$. $V$ is a $T$-cyclic subspace iff each of the eigenspaces of $T$ is $1$-dimensional

**Th:** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Then $T$ is diagonalizable iff the minimal polynomial of $T$ is of the form

$$ \mu_T(z) = \prod_{k =1}^n(z-\lambda_k) $$

$\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$ are distinct eigenvalues of $T$

**************Prop:************** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$, then if $\mu_T( z) = \sum_{k =1}^ma_k z^k$, then

$$ \mu_{T^*} (z) = \sum_{k =1}^m \overline{a_k} z^k $$

**Prop:** Let $T \in \mathcal L(V)$, $T$ is invertible iff $\mu_T(0) \ne 0$. Given $T$ invertible and ${\mu_T(t) = \sum_{k = 0}^m a_k t^k}$, then

$$ T^{-1} = \frac{-1}{a_0} \sum_{k = 1}^m a_k T^{k-1} $$

**Prop:** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space, and suppose that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits. Let $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_m$ be the distinct eigenvalues of $T$, and for each $i$ let $p_i$ be the number of rows in the largest Jordan block corresponding to $A_i$ in a Jordan canonical form of $T$. Then the minimal polynomial of $T$ is

$$ \mu_T (t) = \prod_{k =1}^m (t-\lambda_k)^{p_k} $$

**Def:** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$, and let $x \in V$ be a nonzero vector in $V$. The polynomial $p(t)$ is called a $T$-********annihilator******** of $x$ if $p(t)$ is a monic polynomial of least degree for which $p(T)(x) = 0$

**Prop:** Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$, and let $x \in V$ be a nonzero vector in $V$. The

- The vector $x$ has a unique $T$-annihilator, sometimes denoted as $\mu_{T, x}$
- The $T$-annihilator of $x$ divides any polynomial $g(t)$ for which $g(T) =0$
- If $p(t)$ is the $T$-annihilator of $x$ and $W$ is the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $x$, then $p(t)$ is the minimal polynomial of $T|_W$, and $\dim W$equals the degree of $p(t)$
- The degree of the $T$-annihilator of $x$ is $1$ iff $x$ is an eigenvector of $T$
