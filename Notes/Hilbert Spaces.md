**Def:** Let $(V, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ be an inner product space, we say that the inner product is strictly positive definite if $\|v\| = 0$ iff $v = 0$.

**Def:** An inner product space where the inner product is strictly positive-definite, and is complete with the induced norm is a *Hilbert space*. If either of the conditions fail, the space is a called a *pre-Hilbert space*

We see that $\Bbb R^n$ and $\Bbb C^n$ are examples of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.  While $\ell^2(\Bbb Z)$ and $\ell^2(\Bbb N)$ are examples of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. An extremely important example are the $L^2[a,b]$ spaces
