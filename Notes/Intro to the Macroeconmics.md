# GDP

The measure of *aggregate output* in the national income called the *gross domestic product* of *GDP*, for short. 

1. GDP is the Value of the *Final Goods* and Services Produced in the Economy during a Given Period
2. GDP is the Sum of Value Added in the Economy during a Given Period

The First definition gives us the algebraic: $$\text{GDP} = \sum_{i = 1}^n P_i \cdot Q_i$$where:
- $P_i$, price of good or service $i$
- $P_i$, quantity of good or service $i$
- $n$, total number of goods and services produced

The two definitions imply that the value of the final goods and services (definition 1), can also be thought of as the sum of the value added by all the firms in the economy (definition 2). This is through looking at the GDP through production.

3. GDP is the Sum of Incomes in the Economy during a Given Period

This is seeing the GDP through the through the income. 

*Nominal GDP* is the sum of the quantities of final goods produced times their current price. This definition makes clear that nominal GDP increases over time for two reasons:
- The production of most goods increases over time
- The price of most goods increases over time

Our goal is to measure production and its change over time, we need to eliminate the effect of increasing prices. 

We have the *Real GDP* is constructed as the sum of the quantities of final goods times *constant* prices

- Nominal GDP is also called *dollar GDP* or *GDP in current dollars*
- Real GDP is also called: *GDP in terms of goods*, *GCD in constant dollars*, *GDP adjusted for inflation*.
- GDP will refer to *real* GDP and $Y_t$ will denote the *real GDP in year* $t$.
- Nominal GDP, and variables measure in the current currency will be denoted by a dollar sign in front of them, for example $\$Y_t$ for nominal GDP in year $t$

We hace focused so far on the *level* of real GDP. This is an important number that gives the economic size of a country. Equally important is the level of *real GDP per person*, the ratio of real GDP to the population of the country. It gives us the average standard of living of the country.

In assessing the performance of the economy from year to year, the economist focus, on the rate of growth of real GDP, often called just *GDP growth*. Periods of GDP growth are called *expansions*. Periods of negative GDP growth are called *recessions*.

It just the formula $$\frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}$$and it is expressed as a percentage.

# Unemployment Rate

We start with two definitions:
- *Employment* is the number of people who have a job
- *Unemployment* is the number of people who do not have a job but are looking for one
- The *labor force* is the sum of the employment and unemployment
$$L = N + U$$
where $L$ is the labor force, $N$ is the employment and $U$ is the unemployment.

The *unemployment rate* is the ratio of number of people who are unemployed to the number of people in the labor force: $$u =\frac{U}{L}$$
The tricky part to measure is unemployment, since it depends on how to quantify when people want to work. 

We have that in the U.S. a person is classified as unemployed if *they have been looking for a job in the last 4 weeks*. Most other countries use a similar definition of unemployment. 

Note that only those *looking for a job* are counted as unemployed< those who do not have a job and are not looking for are counted as *not in the labor force*. When unemployment is high, some of the unemployed give up are known as *discouraged workers*. When the economy slows down, we typically observe both an increase in unemployment and an increase in the number who drop out of the labor force.

A Higher unemployment rate is typically associated with a lower *participation rate*, define as the ratio of the labor force to the total population of working age.

Unemployment is important to economist because of two reasons. They care about the unemployment because of its direct effects on the welfare of the unemployed. We also care about the mean duration of unemployment. 

The economists also care about the unemployment rate because it provides a signal that the economy may not be using some of its resources. When unemployment is high, many workers who want to woke fo not find jobs; the economy is clearly not using its human resources effectively. A low unemployment rate can also be problematic, since it signals that the economy its overusing its resources and run into labor shortages.

# Inflation Rate

*Inflation* us a sustained rise in the general level of prices, the *price level*. The *inflation rate* is the rate at which the price level increases. We have a similar definition for *deflation*.

This remark motivates the definition of the GDP deflator. The *GDP deflator* in year $t$, $P_t$ is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP in year $t$: $$P_t = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}_t}{\text{Real GDP}_t} = \frac{\$Y_t}{Y_t}$$
We see that, the year in which, by construction, real GDP is equal to nominal GDP, this definition implies that the price level is equal to $1$. This is worth emphasising: The GDP deflator is called an *index number*. 

> Index numbers are often set equal to $100$, in the base year, rather than to $1$

Its level is chosen arbitrarily and has no economic interpretation. But is rate of change $$\pi_t= \frac{(P_t- P_{t-1})}{P_{t-1}}$$ (which we shall denote by $\pi_t$) has clear economic interpretation: It gives the rate at which the general prices increases over time: the *rate of inflation*

One advantage to defining the price level as the GDP deflator is that it implies a simple relation between *nominal* GDP, *real* GDP, and the GDP *deflator*: $$\$Y_t = P_t Y_t$$
Through some kind of weird definitions, we see that the rate of growth of the nominal GDP is equal to the rate of inflation plus the rate of growth of real GDP

### Consumer Price Index

The GDP deflator gives the average price of output, the final goods *produced* in the economy. Consumers care about the average price of consumption, the goods they *consume*. The two prices need not be the same: the set of goods produced in the economy is not the same set of goods purchased by consumers. 

To measure the average price of consumption, or, equivalently, the *cost of living*, macroeconomists look at another index, the *Consumer Price Index or CPI*.

The CPI gives the cost in dollars of a specific list of goods and services over time. The list, which is based on a detailed study of consumer spending, attempts to represent the consumption basket of a typical urban consumer.

There's definitely a link between the GDP deflator and the CPI, and they usually can differ slightly, but they can get separated. By this strong connection, we can assume that the two indexes move together so we don't need to distinguish them.
