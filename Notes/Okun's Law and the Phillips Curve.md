# Okun's Law

Intuition suggests that if output growth is high, unemployment will decrease, and this is indeed true. This relation was first examined by U.S. economist Arthur Okun and for the reason has been known as *Okun's Law* (this is not a low but an empirical regularity)

More symbolically, we have that $$\Delta Y = k-c\Delta u$$
- $\Delta Y$ is the change in real GDP
- $k$ is the growth rate of potential GDP
- $c$ is Okun's coefficient, which typically ranges from $2$ to $3$
- $\Delta u$ is the change in the unemployment rate

# Phillips Curve

Okun's implies that, strong enough growth, one can decrease the unemployment rate to very low levels. Intuition suggests that, when unemployment becomes very low, the economy is likely to overhear, ans this will lead to upward pressure on inflation.

This relation was first explored in 1598 by a New Zealand economist, A. W. Phillips, and has become known as the *Phillips curve*. Since the, the Phillips curve has been redefined as a relation between the *change in rate of inflation* and the unemployment rate.

If we examine a Phillips curve we can see a that has a negative slope.

Clearly, a successful economy is an economy that combines high output growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. Which begs the question, can all these objectives be achieves simultaneously?.
