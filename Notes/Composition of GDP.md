The decomposition of GDP typically used by macroeconomists:
- First comes *consumption* which we will be denote by the letter $C$. These are the goods and services purchased by consumers. Consumption is by far the largest component of the GDP, in general.
- Second comes *investment* denoted by $I$, sometimes called *fixed investment* to distinguish from inventory investment. Investment si the sum of *nonresidential investment*, and *residential investment*.
- Third comes *government spending* denoted by $G$. The represents the purchases of goods and services by the federal state, and local governments. $G$ doesn't include *government transfers*

The sum of these three is the *purchases of goods and services by citizens, firms, and the government*. To determine the purchases of all goods and services we need two more steps:
- First, we add *exports* denoted by $X$, the purchases of goods and services by foreigners. Second, we must subtract *imports*, denoted by $IM$, the purchase of foreign goods and services. 

The difference between exports and imports is called *net exports* $X- IM$, or the *trade balance*. If exports are less than imports, the country is said to run a *trade deficit*. If exports exceed import, the country is said to run a *trade surplus*.

In any given year, production and sales need not be equal. Some goods produced in a given year are not sold in that year but in later years. And some of the goods sold in a given year may have been produced in a previous year. The difference between goods produced and goods sold in a given a year, the difference between production and sales, in other words, is called *inventory investment*

# Demand for Goods

Denote the total demand for goods by $Z$. Using the decomposition of GDP, we can write $Z$ as $$Z:= C+ I + G+ X-IM$$
We need a couple of simplifications to understand $Z$ better.
- Assume that all firms produce the same good, which can then used by the consumers consumption, by firms for investment, or by the government. With this *big* simplification, we need to look at only one market, and think about what determines supply and demand in the market.
- Assume that firms are willing to supply any amount of good at a given price level $P$. This assumption allows us to focus on the role demand plays in the determination of output.
- Assume that the economy is *closed*, that it doesn't trade with the rest of the world. 

Under the assumption that the economy is closed, $X = IM = 0$, so the demand for goods $Z$ is simply the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending: $$Z = C + I +G$$

## Consumption $(C)$

Consumption decisions depend on many factors. But the main one is surely, more precisely *disposable income* $(Y_D)$. When their disposable incomes goes up, people buy more goods: when it goes down they buy fewer goods. We can write: $$
\begin{align*}C = C&(Y_D)\\ &(+) \end{align*}$$
This is a formal way of stating that consumption $C$ is a function of disposable income $Y_D$. The function $C(Y_D)$ is called *consumption function*. The positive sign below $Y_D$ reflects the fact that $C(Y_D)$ is an increasing function. Economists call such an equation a *behavioural equation* to indicate that the equation captures some aspect of behaviour. 

It is reasonable to assume that the relation consumption and disposable income is given by the simpler relation: $$C = c_0 + c_1 Y_D$$
The relation between consumption and disposable income is then characterised by two *parameters* $c_0$ and $c_1$.
- The parameter $c_1$ is called the *propensity to consume*. (it is also called the *marginal propensity to consume*). A natural restriction on $c_1$ is that it be positive and less than one, people are likely to consume a part of any increase in disposable income and save the rest. So $0<c_1 < 1$
- The parameter $c_0$ has a literal interpretation. It is what people would consume if their disposable income in the current year was $0$. People still consume so, we have that $c_0 > 0$

Next we need to define disposable income $Y_D$. Disposable income is given by $$Y_D := Y - T$$
Where $Y$ is income and $T$ is taxes paid minus government transfers received by consumers. For short, we will refer to $T$ simply as taxes, but remember that it is equal to taxes minus transfers. Replacing $Y_D$ into the consumption function $$C = c_0 + c_1( Y- T)$$
We see that $C$ is function of income $Y$ and taxes $T$. 
# Investment $(I)$

Models have two types variables. Some variables depend on other variables in the model and are therefor explained in the model. Variables like these are called *endogenous variables*. This was the case for consumption. Other variables are not explained within the model but are instead taken as a given. Variables like these are called *exogenous variables*. This is how we will treat investment here. $$ I = \bar I$$
Putting a bar on investment is a simple typographical way to remind us that we take investment as a given. We take investment as given to keep our model simple, but the assumption is not innocuous. It will imply that investment doesn't respond to changes in production which is not real.

# Government spending $(G)$

The third component of demand in our model is government spending $G$. Together with taxes $T$, $G$ describes the *fiscal policy*, the choice of taxes and spending by the government. We will assume that $G$ and $T$ to be exogenous is different from the reason we assumed investment is exogenous. 
- First, governments do not behave with the same regularity of consumers and firms, so there's no reliable rule we could write for $G$ or $T$. 
- Second, and more importantly, one of the tasks of macroeconomists is to think about the implications of alternative spending and tax decisions. We will treat them as additional variables, and will not be tried to be explained.
