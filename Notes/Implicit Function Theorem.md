Let $Y$ be a Banach space, $\Omega$ an open subset of $Y$, $\varphi:\Omega\to \Bbb R^m$ a class $¸\mathcal C ^1$ function, and $c \in \Bbb R^m$. Our interest lies in getting information about the set of solutions $u \in \Omega$, with the equation $$\varphi(u) = c$$which we denote $$M := \{u \in \Omega \mid \varphi(u) = c\}$$

**Def**: We say that $c \in \Bbb R^m$ is a *regular value of* $\varphi:\Omega \to \Bbb R^m$ if $\varphi'(u):Y\to \Bbb R^m$ is surjective for all $u \in M := \varphi^{-1}[\{c\}]$.  The vector subspace $$T_uM := \ker{\varphi'(u)} = \{ v \in Y \mid \varphi'(u) v = 0\}$$ of $Y$ is called the *tangent space to* $M$ at the point $u \in M$. 
If $M = \varnothing$, then $c$ is a regular value of $\varphi$. If $c$ is a regular value of $\varphi$ and $M \ne \varnothing$, necessarily $\dim Y \ge m$. We also see that since $\varphi'(u) :Y \to \Bbb R^m$ is continuous, the tangent space $T_uM$ is a closed subspace of $Y$, and thus, a Banach space. 

We see that $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\Bbb R^n$, and $\varphi:\Omega \to \Bbb R$ is of class $\mathcal C^1$, then $c$ is a regular value of $\varphi$ iff $\nabla \varphi(\xi) \ne 0$ for each $\xi \in M$.

We see that $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\Bbb R^n$, and $\varphi:\Omega \to \Bbb R^m$ is of class $\mathcal C^1$, with $m \le n$, then $c$ is a regular value of $\varphi$ iff $$
\{\nabla \varphi_1(\xi), \dots, \nabla \varphi_m(\xi)\}$$is linearly independent for each $\xi \in M$. In this case, $$T_uM= \{y \in \Bbb R^n \mid y \cdot \nabla \varphi_i(\xi) = 0, \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\}$$
The orthogonal complement of the space generated by $\{\nabla \varphi_1(\xi), \dots, \nabla \varphi_m(\xi)\}$

With this we can see that the tangent space defined by [[The Gradient]] or in [[Differentiablity of Real valued functions of Rn]] is the almost the same since, the one defined there had the point $u$ in the tangent space and behaved like a displaced version of the tangent space defined here

**Prop:** If $Y$ is a Banach space, $T \in \mathcal B(Y, R^m)$ is surjective and $V := \ker T$, then there exists a closed lineal subspace $W$ of $Y$ such that $T|_W:W \to \Bbb R^m$   of $T$ to $W$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces and the linear function $$\iota: V\times W \to Y, \qquad  \iota(v, w) = v+w$$is a homeomorphism

We see that if $c$ is a regular value of $\varphi$ then for each $u \in M$, there exists a closed subspace $W_u$ of $Y$ such that the function $$\iota: T_uM \times W_u \to Y \qquad \iota(v, w) := v+w$$is a Banach isomorphism.

# Lemas For the Implicit Function Theorem

We can see that without loss of generality, we can make $c= 0$. We can have $\tilde \varphi (v, w) = \varphi(v, w) -c$, satisfies that $\tilde \varphi(v_0, w_0) = 0$ iff $\varphi(v_0, w_0) =c$, and partial derivatives are the same for $\tilde \varphi$ and $\varphi$.

For this small section $V, W, Z$ are Banach spaces and $\Omega$ an open subset of $V\times W$, $\varphi:\Omega\to Z$ is a class $\mathcal C^1$ on $\Omega$, and $(v_0, w_0)\in \Omega$ such that $$\varphi(v_0, w_0) = 0 \qquad T_0 := \partial_2\varphi(v_0, w_0) \in \mathcal H(W, Z)$$Dado $(v, w)\in \Omega$, we define $$\psi_v(w) := w-T_0^{-1}\varphi(v, w)$$
We get that $$\varphi(v, w) = 0 \iff T_0^{-1}\varphi(v, w) = 0 \iff \psi_v(w) =w$$
**Lemma:** There exists $\delta, \eta>0$ such that:
- $\overline B_V(v_0, \delta) \times \overline B_W(w_0, \eta) \subseteq \Omega$
- $\partial_2\varphi(v, w) \in \mathcal H(W, Z)$ for any $v \in\overline B_V(v_0, \delta)$, $w \in \overline B_W(w_0, \eta)$
- $\|\psi_v(w) - w_0\| <\eta$ for any $v \in\overline B_V(v_0, \delta)$, $w \in \overline B_W(w_0, \eta)$
- $\|\psi_v(w_1) - \psi_v(w_2)\| \le \frac{3}{4} \|w_1 - w_2\|$ for any $v \in\overline B_V(v_0, \delta)$, $w \in \overline B_W(w_0, \eta)$

**Lemma:** For $\delta, \eta>0$ from the lemma above, we see that it satisfies the following:
- for each $v \in \overline B_V(v_0, \delta)$ there's $f(v) \in \overline B_W(w_0, \eta)$ such that $$\varphi(v, f(v)) = 0$$and $f(v)$ is the unique element of $\overline B_W(w_0, \eta)$ with this property
- The function $f:B_V(v_0, \delta) \to W$ is of class $\mathcal C^1$ and $$f'(v) = -[\partial_2\varphi(v, f(v))] ^{-1}\circ \partial _1 \varphi(v, f(v))$$

# Implicit Function Theorem
Let $V, W, Z$ be Banach spaces, $\Omega$ an open subset of $V\times W$, $(v_0 w_0)\in \Omega$ and $\varphi:\Omega \to Z$ be a function of class $\mathcal C^k$ on $\Omega$. If $\varphi(v_0, w_0) = c$, and $\partial_2 \varphi(v_0, w_0) \in \mathcal B(W, Z)$ is a Banach isomorphism, then there exists $\delta, \eta>0$ such that $B_V(v_0, \delta) \times B_W(w_0, \eta) \subseteq \Omega$ and a function $f: B_V(v_0, \delta) \to W$ of class $\mathcal C^k$ has the following properties:
- The set of solutions $(v, w) \in B_V(v_0, \delta) \times B_W(w_0, \eta)$ of the equation $$\varphi(v, w)=c$$coincide with the function, meaning $f(v) = w$. In particular $f(v_0) = w_0$ and $f(v) \in B_W(w_0, \eta)$ for all $v \in B_V(v_0, \delta)$ 
- For each $v \in B_V(v_0, \delta)$ it satisfies that $\partial_2\varphi(v, f(v))$ is a Banach isomorphism and $$f'(v) = - [\partial_2\varphi(v, f(v))]^{-1} \circ \partial_1 \varphi(v, f(v))$$
**Cor:** If $c\in \Bbb R$ is a regular value of $\varphi:\Omega \to \Bbb R^m$ and $u = v_0+w_0\in M$ with $v_0 \in T_uM$ and $w_0 \in W_u$, then there exists $\delta, \eta>0$ and a function $f:B_{T_uM}(v_0, \delta) \to W_u$ of class $\mathcal C^1$ such that
$$M \cap (B_{T_uM}(v_0, \delta) \times B_{W_u}(w_0, \eta)) = \{v + f(v): \mid v \in B_{T_uM}(v_0, \delta)\}$$
Furthermore, $\partial_2 \varphi(v + f(v))$ is an isomorphism and $$f'(v) = -[\partial_2\varphi(v + f(v))]^{-1} \circ \partial_1\varphi(v+f(v))$$for each $v \in B_{T_uM}(v_0, \delta)$. 

# Inverse Function Theorem
Let $V, W$ be Banach spaces, and $\Omega$ be an open subset of $V$, $\varphi:\Omega \to W$ be a function of class $\mathcal C^k$ on $\Omega$ with $1 \le k \le \infty$, and $v_0 \in \Omega$. If $\varphi'(v_0) \in \mathcal H(V,W)$, then there exist an open set $\Omega'$ of $W$ and another open set $\Omega''$ of $V$ suc that $v_0 \in \Omega'' \subseteq \Omega$, $\varphi(\Omega'') = \Omega'$ and and the function $$\varphi|_{\Omega''}:\Omega'' \to \Omega'$$is an homeomorphism which inverse $\psi := (\varphi|_{\Omega''}):\Omega' \to \Omega''$ is of class $\mathcal C^k$ on $\Omega'$ and it satisfies that $$\psi'(\varphi(v_0)) = (\varphi'(v_0))^{-1}$$
