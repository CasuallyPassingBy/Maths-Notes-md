**Def:** Let $G$ be a group, and $a, b \in G$, then the commutator of $a$ and $b$ is $[a, b] := a^{-1}b^{-1}ab\in G$. The commutator is the element $e$ iff $ab = ba$, that is $a$ and $b$ commute. In general, $ab = ba[a, b]$, like how close are those elements to commute. An element of $G$ of the form $[a, b]$ is called a commutator. 

The *commutator subgroup* $[G, G]$ or the *derived subgroup* denoted as $G'$ or $G^{(1)}$: it is the subgroup generated by all the commutators. By definition, any element of $[G, G]$ is of the form $$[a_1, b_1] \cdots [a_n, b_n]$$for some $n \in \Bbb N$, and where $a_i, b_i \in G$. Doing some elementary algebra we get that $[G, G] \trianglelefteq G$.

**Prop:** Let $G$ be a group and $H \trianglelefteq G$. $G/H$ is abelian iff $[G, G] \le H$.

In particular $G/[G, G]$ is abelian and it is called the abelianization of $G$, usually denoted as $G^{\text{ab}}$ or $G_{\text{ab}}$.  

A group $G$ is called *perfect* if $G = [G, G]$. This like the opposite of being abelian.
