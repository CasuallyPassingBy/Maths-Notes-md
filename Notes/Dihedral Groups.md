In general, a regular polygon with $n$ sides centred at the origin of $\Bbb R^2$. If we consider its symmetries, by labelling the vertices from $1$ to $n$, consecutively and counterclockwise, the symmetries would be the transformations of the polygon that move the $n$ vertices to the same $n$ vertices. 

The group of symmetries $D_n$ of a regular polygons of $n$ sides is a subgroup of $S_n$. 

The symmetries of the polygon include the $n$ rotations $r^k$, where $r = r_{2\pi /n}$ is the rotation by the angle $2\pi/n$, and can be written (in the context of $S_n$) as $$r = (1, 2, \dots, n )$$
and the reflection that passes through the $v_1$ vertex and the centre of the $n$-gon (in the context of $S_n$) can be written: $$\rho = \begin{pmatrix}
v_1 & v_2 & v_3  & \cdots & v_{n-1} & v_n \\
v_1 & v_n & v_{n-1} & \cdots & v_3 & v_2
\end{pmatrix}$$
the relation $r^n = \rho^2 = e$ and $\rho r \rho = r^{-1}$.  

**Prop:** $D_n$ is generated by $r$ and $\rho$. 

**Prop:** $|D_n| = 2n$. 

**Def**: We call $D_n$ the *dihedral group of order $n$*

**Prop:** let $r = r_{2\pi /n}$ then $R_n := \langle r \rangle \cong \Bbb Z_n$  

**Prop**: $R_n \trianglelefteq D_n$, since $[D_n: R_n] = 2$, and $D_n/R_n \cong \Bbb Z_2$
