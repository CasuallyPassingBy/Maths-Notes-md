**Def:** A morphism $\phi: G \to G$ that is also a bijective. Them $\phi$ is called an automorphism. The set of all automorphisms of $G$, is denoted as $\text{Aut}(G)$. 

**Prop:** $(\text{Aut}(G),\; \circ\; , \;\text{id}_G)$  is a group

**Prop:** Let $G$ a group and for any element $h\in G$ fixed, then we define the function $c_h: G \to G$ defined by $c_h(g) = hgh^{-1}$. $c_h \in \text{Aut}(G)$. The automorphisms of the form $c_h$, defined by conjugation by $h$ are called the internal automorphisms of $G$. 

**Prop:** Let $G$ be a group, and we define the group homomorphism $c : G \to \text{Aut}(G)$, for $h, g\in G$, then $c_h(g) = hgh^{-1}$
