Let $p$ be a in $(0,1)$. It is called the quantile of order $p$ of a random variable $X$, or of its distribution function, to any real number $x_p$ that satisfies this conditions 
$$
P(X\le x_p)\ge p \qquad P(X\ge x_p)\ge 1-p
$$
Sometimes quantiles of order $1/4$, $1/2$ and $3/4$ are called *quartiles*. In particular we call the quantile of order $1/2$ is called the *median*.
