Let $a, b \in \Bbb Z$, the equation $ax+by = c$ has solutions on $\Bbb Z^2$ iff $\gcd(a,b) \mid c$, and their solution is of the form, given $x_0, y_0$ be a particular solution of the equation, then all other solutions are of the form:

$$ x = x_0 +\left(\frac{b}{d}\right)t, \text{ and, } y = y_0 -\left(\frac{a}{d}\right)t $$

where $t \in \Bbb Z$.

_Corollary:_ if $\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $x_0, y_0$ be a particular solution of the Diophantine equation ${ax+by=c}$, then all other solution are of the form:

$$ x = x_0 +bt, \text{ and, } y = y_0 -at $$
